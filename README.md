sqlalchemy-basics
Program based on joining of tables.
This code is to join the tables of two columns.
It also has the special feature to find the uniqueness of the values by using the tables of the columns.
The code will first insert the created columns into respective created table and then we insert the values to the table.
With that values we join the tables with the help of unique column name by using primary keys.
